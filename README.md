## Description

_This is an MVC application that was built using C#. The purpose of this application is to allow a salon owner to quickly and easily identify a complete list of both their stylists and their client. When the application runs, the salon owner can add a stylist name. After the stylist is inputted using the "add" button, the owner can then add specific clients to that specific stylist. The client details support a name and description of the services they need done. Once the client is added, they will appear under that specific stylist's list._
